							- Relative  text type  frequency compares the frequency in a specific text type to the frequency in the whole  corpus.
							- It shows how typical the word(s) is of a specific text type, e.g. of 
							  the spoken part of the corpus or of a particular website where the texts
							   were downloaded from.
							- The number is the relative frequency of the  query  result divided by the relative size of the particular text type. It can be interpreted as *how much more/less frequent is the result of the query in this text type compared to the whole corpus*.
						- another popular measure: *frequency per million words* (pmw)

- practice: studying lexical innovation using corpora

	  collapsed:: true
		- *upskill*
		- *hyperlocal*
		- *solopreneur*
		- *alt-right*
		- *alt-left*
		- *poppygate*
	- for each of these words,
		- in the [[JSI web corpus]], determine
			- it’s total frequency
			- it’s frequency over time: which was the `Year` it was used the most?
		- in the [[enTenTen20]] corpus, determine
			- in which `Topic` was it used the most?
		- take notes and compare your results
			- which words show highest/lowest degrees of conventionality?
			- for which words is there a discrepancy to the results on Twitter?
