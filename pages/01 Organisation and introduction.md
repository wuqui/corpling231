		- ### What is corpus linguistics about?
			- Corpus linguistics is a research methodology within the field of linguistics that focuses on the systematic study of language using large and diverse **collections of authentic texts**, known as [[corpora]].
			- These collections of language data, either written or spoken, provide a comprehensive and [empirical basis]([[empirical data]]) for the analysis of
				- language use (e.g. collocational patterns such as *pretty woman*)
				- [[linguistic variation]] across different text types or communities (e.g.  neologisms such as *smash*)
				- [[language change]] (e.g. *going to* future)
			- The primary goal of corpus linguistics is to investigate linguistic phenomena and patterns by examining [real-world language usage]([[empirical data]]).
				- This approach contrasts with more traditional linguistic methods that rely heavily on introspection and theoretical speculation (e.g. Chomsky).
			- Corpus linguistics has gained significant momentum in recent years, thanks to advances
				- in [[data]] (e.g. social media and web corpora) and
					- [[Twitter]] and [[Reddit]]
				- [[methods]] (e.g. social network analysis, machine learning).
		- ### What is corpus linguistics good for?
			- Corpus linguistics as a [[usage-based approach]] to linguistic analysis
				- Corpus linguistics is highly valuable from a usage-based approach to linguistics, as it emphasizes the importance of **actual language use** in shaping linguistic knowledge and structure.
				- The usage-based perspective posits that **linguistic structure and knowledge emerge from the patterns** and regularities that speakers encounter in their experience with language.
				- In this context, corpus linguistics provides a powerful toolset for investigating these patterns and regularities, offering several advantages:
					- **Authentic language data**: Corpus linguistics relies on large and diverse collections of authentic texts, which represent real-world language use. This ensures that the patterns and structures uncovered through corpus analysis are grounded in genuine linguistic behavior, rather than relying on idealized or artificial examples.
					- [[quantitative approach]]: Corpus linguistics allows for the quantitative analysis of linguistic phenomena, such as  [frequency counts]([[frequency]]) and [statistical measures]([[statistics]]). This enables researchers to identify and describe patterns and regularities that emerge from language use, supporting the usage-based claim that linguistic structure is shaped by frequency and distributional patterns in the input.
					- [Collocations]([[collocations]]) and [[constructions]]: The usage-based approach posits that language is composed of form-meaning pairings, known as constructions, which range from morphemes and words to idiomatic expressions and complex syntactic structures. Corpus linguistics offers tools for identifying and analyzing collocations and constructions in large datasets, contributing to our understanding of the relationships between form, meaning, and use.
					- [Variability]([[linguistic variation]]) and context sensitivity: Corpus linguistics enables the examination of language use across different contexts, genres, and [registers]([[register]]). This allows researchers to investigate how linguistic features and structures vary and adapt to different situations, providing insights into the dynamic nature of language and its sensitivity to context, which is a key aspect of the usage-based approach.
					- [Language change]([[language change]]) and development: Corpus linguistics can be applied to [diachronic]([[diachronic]]) and [synchronic]([[synchronic]]) data, allowing researchers to track language change over time and compare different stages of language development. This helps to shed light on the emergence and evolution of linguistic structures, which is of particular interest to [usage-based theorists]([[usage-based approach]]) who seek to explain language change as a result of cumulative changes in usage patterns.
					- Data-driven [language teaching]([[language teaching]]) and [learning]([[language learning]]): The usage-based approach emphasizes the importance of [[exposure]] to authentic [[language input]] in the acquisition process. Corpus linguistics can inform the development of language teaching materials and methods, by providing insights into the most [frequent]([[frequency]]) and relevant structures, vocabulary, and collocations that learners need to acquire.
