		- What is corpus linguistics about?
		  collapsed:: true
			- Corpus linguistics is a research methodology within the field of linguistics that focuses on the systematic study of language using large and diverse **collections of authentic texts**, known as [[corpora]].
			- These collections of language data, either written or spoken, provide a comprehensive and [empirical basis]([[empirical data]]) for the analysis of
			  collapsed:: true
				- language use (e.g. collocational patterns such as *pretty woman*)
				- [[linguistic variation]] across different text types or communities (e.g.  neologisms such as *smash*)
				- [[language change]] (e.g. *going to* future)
			- The primary goal of corpus linguistics is to investigate linguistic phenomena and patterns by examining [real-world language usage]([[empirical data]]).
			  collapsed:: true
				- This approach contrasts with more traditional linguistic methods that rely heavily on introspection and theoretical speculation (e.g. Chomsky).
			- Corpus linguistics has gained significant momentum in recent years, thanks to advances

				- in [[data]] (e.g. social media and web corpora) and
				- [[methods]] (e.g. social network analysis, machine learning).
		- Why do we do corpus linguistics?
