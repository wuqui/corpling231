		- society continually changes as new practices and products emerge (e.g. smartphones)
		- these changes typically first manifest themselves in language on the level of lexis in the form of [[neologisms]] (e.g. the words *smartphone* or *iphone*)
		- knowledge of words is [conventional]([[conventionalization]]): speakers learn form-meaning pairings
	- [[theoretical framework]]
		- the [[S-curve model]] of [linguistic innovation]([[linguistic innovation]]) and [change]([[language change]])

			- the more frequently a word is used, the more likely it is

		- [[frequency]] as an indicator for [[entrenchment]] and [conventionality]([[conventionalization]]) ([[Stefanowitsch2017CorpusbasedPerspective]])
			- [[corpus-as-input]]: language used in corpora represents potential [[exposure]] to speakers
			- [[corpus-as-output]]: languaged used by speakers in corpora represents potential degrees of entrenchment
