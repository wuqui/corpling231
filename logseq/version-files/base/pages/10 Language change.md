		- studying the rise and fall of modal verbs in the [[COHA]]
			- for each of the following modal verbs
				- {{embed ((649ac78b-2cb0-4686-9390-52cd05c08ecf))}}
			- determine their absolute and relative frequencies in the decades
				- 1850
				- 1900
				- 1950
				- 2000

			- create bar charts that show
				- whether these individual words show frequency changes over time
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1687959732182_0.png)
				- whether the groups of (1) core and (2) peripheral modal verbs show frequency changes on aggregate
		- Investigating whether those modals that exhibit the highest changes in frequency show (changes in) preferences for specific text types using the [[COCA]]
